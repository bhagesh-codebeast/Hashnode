## Day 1 : Introduction To ML Mystery

## Hi and Welcome
Today I learned some new terms, & their meanings w.r.t. Machine Learning (ML).
ML seems pretty intimidating in the first look... but that isn't enough to make us not want to do something right ?

> I'm going to stick to the end and learn as much as possible as fast as possible.

## Summary :
## A. **What Is Machine Learning? **

## B. **Types of Machine Learning Systems** 

### 1. Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

i. **Supervised learning**

- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests 
- Neural networks

ii. **Unsupervised learning**

> **Clustering**
- K-Means 
- DBSCAN 
- Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) 


> **Anomaly detection and novelty detection**
- One-class SVM 
- Isolation Forest 


> **Visualization and dimensionality reduction** 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
- Kernel PCA 
- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) 
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) 


> **Association rule learning** 
- Apriori 
- Eclat

iii. **Semisupervised learning **

iv. **Reinforcement Learning**


### 2. Batch and Online Learning

i. **Batch learning **

### 3. Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning 

i. **Instance-based learning **

ii. **Model-based learning **


## C. **Main Challenges of Machine Learning **

### 1. Insufficient Quantity of Training Data 

### 2. Nonrepresentative Training Data 

### 3. Poor-Quality Data

### 4. Irrelevant Features 

### 5. Overfitting the Training Data 

### 6. Underfitting the Training Data 

### 7. Stepping Back 


## D. **Testing and Validating **

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection 

### 2. Data Mismatch
